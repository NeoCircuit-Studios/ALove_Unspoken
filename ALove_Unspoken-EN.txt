Chapter 1 – The Beginning of an Unexpected Journey (May–June 2023)

In the spring of 2023, Leo stumbled across a video on TikTok that sparked something unexpected. It featured a charming young man from Russia — confident, fluent in Russian, and committed to working out. Inspired, Leo began learning Russian and threw himself into fitness. Walking to school became his first form of exercise, then biking during vacation. When he returned home, he kept the momentum going, this time with a scooter.

Around that time, as the war between Ukraine and Russia escalated, many Ukrainians sought refuge in Belgium. New faces began appearing in the neighborhood. Leo’s younger sister, Lena, who still attended the school Leo once went to, mentioned that two Ukrainian students had joined her class — and they spoke Russian. This immediately intrigued Leo. His own mother was Russian, and their household was no stranger to the language. This linguistic connection made Leo wonder about these newcomers.

In May, Leo was on his way to the playground with a friend when something unexpected happened. On the road, he spotted a Ukrainian girl — one of the siblings Lena had mentioned. Leo considered greeting her, but hesitation held him back. Still, her presence hinted at something: if she was walking there, she likely lived nearby.

Days passed. One afternoon, driven by a sudden urge to exercise, Leo grabbed his scooter — his bike wasn’t at home at the time — and hit the road. He stopped at a busy intersection just as a bus passed by. Through the glass, he noticed her again. The same Ukrainian girl. She was staring out the window, her face carrying a quiet sadness. Their eyes met for a fleeting moment, and for Leo, time seemed to freeze.

What was her story?
Leo guessed she might be heading toward Oudenaarde, where a school program for Ukrainian students had been set up — the same area as Leo’s upcoming new school. Compelled by instinct, he decided to follow.
Rushing home, Leo searched for something to give him energy. An unopened energy drink caught his eye. He had never tried one before, but now felt like the moment. He drank it and dashed off toward Oudenaarde with determination.

He raced through the streets, scanning every direction, every corner. But there was no sign of her. Despite his efforts, she was nowhere to be found. The exhaustion hit hard. By the time he returned home, Leo collapsed into his seat, overwhelmed and breathless.

The moment was gone.
And with it, the first chapter of a journey had quietly begun.




Chapter 2 – A New Opportunity

Weeks passed. Around school, Leo began to notice more and more Ukrainian students. Among them, he spotted the same Ukrainian girl he had seen on the bus during his scooter ride.

That day, Leo found the courage to greet one of the students with a simple “Привет.” It wasn’t the girl from the bus — he had intended the greeting for her — but instead, he spoke to another student.

The student responded kindly.

In that moment, Leo realized that speaking Russian might be a bridge — a way to connect with these new students who shared a language from his own upbringing. The experience gave him a fresh motivation: to keep improving his Russian, not just for himself, but to truly communicate.



Chapter 3 – A Glimpse of Hope (Edited)

A few days later, Leo found himself on the same bus as the two Ukrainian students from Lena’s school. Lena pointed them out, and Leo quietly mentioned that he had already seen one of them before — on the street.

He felt a small spark of excitement. Sharing the same bus route meant there would be more chances — more opportunities to talk to them.

As the school year came to a close, Leo learned more about his upcoming school: Campus Gelukstede. It offered an OKAN program — a special course designed to help students from other countries learn Dutch and adjust to their new environment.

For Leo, this felt like the perfect setup. It meant he could be of help to Ukrainian students like them.

And maybe, he thought, it would be a chance to do something meaningful — not just for them, but for himself too.



Chapter 4 – Summer of Preparation (September 2023)

Throughout the summer vacation, Leo remained focused. He dedicated himself to learning Russian, practicing consistently in hopes of being able to speak more fluently.

When September arrived and the new school year began, Leo boarded the bus for his first day at Campus Gelukstede. To his surprise, one of the Ukrainian students from Lena’s school was there again — and he, too, was heading to the OKAN program.

Leo wanted to speak to him, but nerves held him back.

Later, he shared his interest with one of the OKAN teachers — his hope to talk with the Ukrainian students. The teacher responded warmly and encouraged him to go for it.



Chapter 5 – Realizations and Friendships

As the weeks went by, Leo formed a new friendship in his class. The bond grew quickly, and soon Leo felt safe enough to open up about something deeply personal — a realization he had come to the year before: that he was different.

This new friend already knew about the Ukrainian boy Leo often mentioned. Leo had spoken about him so frequently that the friend eventually brought it up.

“Maybe you have feelings for him,” the friend suggested.

The words made Leo pause and reflect. And in that moment, something clicked.

The friend was right.




Chapter 6 – Courage and Connection

One day, Leo returned to the OKAN teacher, expressing his frustration. Despite the encouragement, he still hadn’t managed to speak to the Ukrainian students — especially the one who had captured his attention.

His friend overheard and, without hesitation, told the teacher the truth: Leo wanted to talk to a specific boy.

The teacher offered more encouragement, but the hesitation remained.

Eventually, Leo met another student named Emir — a friendly, social classmate who seemed to know everyone, including many Ukrainian students.

Through Emir, Leo finally learned the name of the boy he had been drawn to for so long. His name was Luca.

Hearing the name filled Leo with excitement. But what he observed next struck a different chord.

Luca was often alone. He didn’t seem to have many friends and sometimes even hid in the bathroom to avoid others. It was painful to watch.

Leo tried, more than once, to talk to him — to be a friend. But each attempt seemed to fall short.




Chapter 7 – The First Step (November – December 2023)

By November, Leo felt he couldn’t wait any longer. He wanted Luca to know he existed — to take that first step.

So, he sent a simple message in Russian through Smartschool, hoping Luca would read it.

Later that same day, Leo had no classes and found an opportunity to wait for Luca after his lesson. As he sat reading his Russian book, another Ukrainian student approached and started speaking to him in Russian.

Luca overheard.

To Leo’s surprise, Luca walked up to him. In Russian, he said, “I see you a lot on the bus. I didn’t know you spoke Russian.”

Before Leo could say much in return, Luca’s teacher called him back to class.

It was only a brief exchange — just a few words.

But for Leo, it felt like a breakthrough. A small conversation, yet a major victory.




Chapter 8 – A Shared Bus Ride / Best Day of Leo's Life So Far (16–11–2023)



After waiting for Luca's class to end, Leo spotted him again. The desire to speak was strong, but fear held him back. Later, Leo waited at the bus station, hoping for another chance.

Just when it seemed like the opportunity had slipped away, Luca boarded the bus — late. He asked the driver something, but the driver didn’t understand. That was Leo’s moment. He called out to Luca, and Luca took the seat beside him.

Leo asked in Russian what Luca had been trying to say. But he couldn’t understand the reply. It seemed to disappoint Luca a little — perhaps because Leo’s Russian wasn’t strong enough yet. It wasn’t the smoothest start, but Leo tried switching to Dutch.

He asked if Luca had a phone or a phone number.

Luca replied, “I forgot it in Ukraine, but my dad will get it for me.”

Leo was surprised. Forgotten in Ukraine? Could it really be? Maybe — Leo thought — maybe there’s so much he doesn’t know about what Luca has been through.

Then came another question: “Why Belgium? There are better places than Belgium.”

Luca explained, “My mom can speak French, so we first planned to go to France. But a friend of a friend of my dad said he could arrange a house in Belgium, so we came here.”

The conversation continued. They talked about many things. Luca’s Dutch was surprisingly good, and his accent — Leo noticed — was adorable.

To Leo, the whole ride felt perfect. When he got off the bus, Luca even waved at him.

That day became something Leo would never forget. The best day of his life so far.

The next morning, Leo greeted Luca again on the bus. There were awkward silences — likely because of the language gap — but something had begun. A small bond was taking root.

One moment especially stood out.

Luca and Leo were seated apart, but directly across from each other, with someone else in between. Luca stared quietly out the window, lost in thought. Leo glanced at him — trying not to be obvious. 
But Luca noticed. He turned, met Leo’s eyes — and gave a quick, knowing wink.
Leo blushed and quickly looked away. But inside, it felt like something special.

A few days later, Luca finally read Leo’s message and replied in Dutch: “Who are you???”
Then he approached Leo directly and asked, “Is your name Leo?”

Leo answered yes.



Chapter 9: Growing Distance (December – January 2024)



The December–January holiday seemed to stretch on forever. When school finally resumed, Leo eagerly looked for Luca on the bus—but he wasn’t there. At school, Leo caught glimpses of him with his friends, but the courage to approach never came. Something felt different, as if a quiet shift had taken place.

Days passed, and their brief interactions faded, dwindling down to almost nothing. Eventually, Leo discovered that Luca was now taking a different bus altogether. It felt as though Luca had moved on… and forgotten him.




Chapter 10: Seeking Help (May – June)



Feeling lost and unsure of what to do, Leo confided in a new and very kind OKAN teacher about Luca. The teacher, who was deeply understanding, offered to speak with Luca. Leo hoped that this would be the spark that could renew their fading connection.

Despite the distance that had grown between them, Leo held on to the hope that he could reconnect with Luca. With encouragement from friends and teachers, he believed that one day he might find the courage to talk to Luca again—perhaps even share his true feelings.

But above all, Leo simply wanted Luca to feel good in Belgium… and maybe, just maybe, to be his friend. Yet one thing was clear—if there was ever going to be another moment between them, time was running out.




Chapter 11 – Taking Matters into My Own Hands (Edited)


A few days passed, and the OKAN teacher wasn’t able to help Leo reconnect with Luca, which he completely understood. Still, time was running out—only three weeks remained until the end of the school year. Leo knew he had to act quickly. So, just like he had done in November, he decided to send Luca another message via Smartschool.

The message was simple and honest. Leo told Luca that he still cared about him, that he wanted to talk, to help, and that he missed him. But then he remembered that Luca didn’t check Smartschool very often. So, he waited.

A week went by. The message remained unread. Leo waited some more.

Then, he found out that Luca was struggling in class. He had received a volgkaart—a follow-up card that students only got if they were really having trouble with behavior or following the rules. This surprised Leo. On the bus, Luca had always been kind and polite, and before the holidays, he’d seemed so gentle with everyone. Something must have changed during that winter vacation. Leo couldn’t help but wonder what had happened.

Another week passed. Just one week remained.

Still, no response.

Out of options, Leo messaged the IT teacher, asking if she could tell Luca to check his messages. She didn’t reply. He understood—after all, she didn’t know him, and it had been a long shot. So, he continued hoping that Luca would open the message on his own.

The day before the last day of the school year arrived. Still, nothing. Desperate, Leo sent a second message—this time more direct, more honest. He had a plan: on the final day, when students received their report cards, he would go to Luca and talk to him directly.

But fate wasn’t on his side.

Luca wasn’t at school that morning. He showed up later in the day—after Leo had already missed his chance.

Once again, the moment slipped through his fingers.

As he sat alone that evening, Leo wondered silently: Was I being too much? I didn’t want to scare him.



Chapter 12: Still Hope (July – August)

The school year had ended, and Leo hadn’t been able to tell Luca the truth. But he wasn’t ready to give up—not yet.

He still had one plan left. The message he sent through Smartschool had been successfully delivered, which meant that Luca could still see it. Next school year, Luca would be starting regular secondary school, where he would have to use Smartschool more often. If Leo was lucky, maybe—just maybe—Luca would finally read the message. Maybe he would even reply.

That’s what Leo held onto.

For now, all he could do was wait. And hope.

Sometimes, while riding his bike through the city, Leo caught himself scanning every face, wondering if he might see Luca again—just once. You never know. Maybe their paths would cross. Maybe fate would give them one more moment.

God, I miss him, Leo thought. I want him back on the bus. I want to be his best friend. I just… want him.





Chapter 13: It's Been a While (End of August)



It all began when Leo received a call from a friend inviting him to play a game online. The friend casually mentioned that everyone had to pick up their schoolbooks that day. That small detail sparked something in Leo’s mind—if everyone had to collect their books, then Luca likely had to as well. The thought brought a flicker of hope. It was a beautiful, sunny day, and Leo couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe this was the day he might see Luca again.

Later that afternoon, around three o’clock, Leo told his friend he had to go. He got ready and took off on his bike, riding at a calm and steady pace. The destination was Oudenaarde. Once there, the assumption proved to be true—people were everywhere, walking with books, loading car trunks, chatting in the sun. It really was book pickup day. That meant Luca could be nearby.

Leo cycled around, passing the distribution spot. He glanced around—maybe even a little too obviously—but there was no sign of Luca. It felt like a dead end. Maybe Luca had already come and gone. Still, Leo kept looping around the familiar neighborhood, close to both Luca’s old school and his own.

Then, as if fate had intervened, Leo made one last pass near the school building. The traffic was thick, but just as he glanced to the right—there he was. Luca. Leo had such an eye on him that Leo instantly recognized him from a distance. There was no doubt in his mind.

Without hesitation, Leo swerved across the road and headed toward the school entrance where Luca was just walking in. He stared in quiet awe. Luca had a new haircut, and most importantly, he looked healthy, safe, and present in Belgium. That sight alone filled Leo with relief.

Luca noticed someone looking, but probably didn’t realize it was Leo. After all, Leo was almost unrecognizable—dressed in tight speed-biking gear, wearing a helmet and reflective glasses. He looked more like a stranger than a classmate.

Luca disappeared inside the building, and Leo waited.

Ten minutes passed. Luca re-emerged carrying a heavy load of books and headed toward the bus stop. Leo followed from a short distance, walking beside his bike. As Luca settled on a bench to wait for the bus, Leo approached the bus schedule board—pretending to check the times. It was an awkward move, considering he had no reason to take the bus, but he hoped it might somehow grab Luca’s attention.

It didn’t.

Leo checked the schedule and did the math. He could make it to Luca’s next stop before the bus did—if he hurried. He backed up slightly to get out of sight, then cycled ahead at full speed, hoping to cross paths again. He rode in front of where Luca might be able to see him, trying to get noticed—maybe with a wave, maybe just a glance—but Luca was facing the other way. Nothing happened.

Undeterred, Leo kept going. He pedaled fast toward the next bus stop, determined. Once there, he removed his helmet and glasses, hoping to be more recognizable this time. Then he searched for a visible spot where they might lock eyes.

The bus finally arrived.

Leo looked eagerly at the windows, prepared to wave—but by the time he noticed Luca, it was too late. Luca was seated at the back, facing forward, not looking in Leo’s direction at all. No wave. No sign. Just a missed chance.

In a last attempt, Leo tried to follow the bus, hoping Luca might get off at the next stop. If so, maybe there’d still be time to say something, anything. But the bus was too fast, and the hills were steep. Eventually, Leo lost sight of the bus... and of Luca.

It wasn’t the reunion Leo had hoped for. But somehow, seeing Luca again—even for a moment—was something. Maybe not enough… but still something.





Chapter 14: The Unexpected Encounter.
(Friday, August 30th)


Leo saw on Facebook that the official page of Luca’s school had posted:
Nieuwe leerlingen uit de 2de en 3de graad worden op vrijdag 30 augustus om 16u verwacht in de sportzaal op Hoogstraat 10.
In other words, Luca would be in Oudenaarde around 4 o’clock—giving Leo a potential chance to see him again.

Leo spent the entire day waiting for 4 o’clock to arrive. He had a plan: ride his bike to the area, then park somewhere nearby to change into something less conspicuous—just to avoid standing out too much. He wandered around the school, passing by the same street again and again, searching for Luca like, well… a bit of a fool.

After about half an hour, it was already 4:30 PM. Leo found himself standing just beside the school entrance, careful not to be too visible since, technically, he wasn’t supposed to be there as a 10th grader. As more students gathered, he noticed a few Ukrainian students he vaguely recognized—ones who also knew Luca. That meant Luca could show up at any moment.
And he did.

Luca arrived with a group of friends, which made it harder for Leo to approach him. He needed to come up with a quick plan.

Leo decided to ask a teacher he knew for help, hoping they might let him into the school where Luca was headed. While searching, he ran into an old Ukrainian friend from the previous year. After exchanging a few words, Leo helped guide this friend toward the right place, as the boy seemed a little lost.

Meanwhile, Luca and the Ukrainian student entered the school. Leo saw an opportunity and followed them in. At the door stood the teacher Leo knew, and he quickly struck up a conversation. When asked why he was there, Leo simply said he was bored and wanted to look around. To his relief, the teacher said he could go inside if he wanted—and of course, Leo accepted.

Once inside, Leo immediately felt out of place. The room was filled with younger students—7th and 8th graders—staring at him, probably wondering what a 10th grader was doing there. Leo approached another teacher to make small talk and seem more natural. Then, he saw Luca—alone, and seemingly open to conversation.

Just as Leo was about to make his move, the students were called together for a group photo, likely for community guidelines or a Facebook post. Leo stepped back quickly, not wanting to appear awkward in a shot he wasn’t supposed to be in.

After the photo, the students reorganized into their classes. To Leo’s surprise, most of Luca’s friends seemed to be in the 7th grade (though he wasn’t entirely sure), which made Luca the only one from his group placed in 8th grade—or so it appeared. That twist was unexpected.

As the groups formed, Luca stood alone again, but Leo’s attention shifted—his old Ukrainian friend still looked completely lost. Leo couldn’t ignore him, so he stayed to help.

Luca definitely noticed Leo at some point, likely wondering what Leo was doing there again. Leo wanted to speak to him but felt too nervous to initiate anything. After finally helping his lost friend find the right classroom, Leo ended up chatting with a few former teachers. It was nice, but it made him lose sight of where Luca had gone.

As classes began, Leo observed from a distance that Luca’s class was quite small (though he wasn’t certain) and that Luca seemed to be the only Ukrainian in the room (again, possibly mistaken). It looked kind of sad to Leo, thinking Luca might feel isolated with no one to speak his native language to. At the same time, it also meant fewer chances for others to take Luca’s attention away from Leo—unless Luca made new Belgian friends, which could complicate things emotionally.

When the school session ended, parents and students gathered in the playground. Leo ended up talking to the mother of his old Ukrainian friend, bouncing between Dutch, Russian, and English—a surprisingly funny mix. During their chat, Leo saw Luca walking around, possibly searching for his own group. They made brief eye contact—just for a fleeting 300 milliseconds—before Leo looked away to avoid making it awkward.

Before Leo could even process it, Luca had disappeared again. He had likely left while Leo was still in conversation.

Eventually, everyone began heading out. Leo spotted Luca once more in front of the school, hanging around with his friends. His old Ukrainian friend then suggested they grab a pizza together. They ordered one and went to the station where Luca might be. But by the time they got there, Luca was already gone.




Chapter 15 – The Waiting Game (Edited)


It was September 1st, but since it fell on a Sunday, there was no school. That meant one more day of vacation—something Leo didn’t mind at all. He spent part of the day checking the school platform, where he had sent a message to Luca. To his relief, the message was still there—untouched and not deleted. That alone felt like a small victory.

Still, Luca hadn’t read it yet. Leo kept hoping he would, maybe soon.

But then something occurred to him. If Luca was really in 8th grade, maybe Leo had been wrong about his age. He did a little mental math—Luca might be around fourteen years old. That thought made Leo pause.

It felt… awkward.

Leo was taller, older, and more experienced, and realizing the age gap between them stirred an uncomfortable self-consciousness. Was he being weird? Was it inappropriate to care this much?

The thoughts looped in his head. But another part of him pushed back:

Connections aren’t always about age, are they?

Sometimes, it’s something deeper—something that goes beyond numbers. Leo didn’t fully understand what he felt, but it was more than passing curiosity. It was tied to admiration, longing, and a need for meaning in a world that often felt too quiet.




Chapter 16 – A New School Year (Edited)


It had been three weeks since the new school year started, and Leo was learning to cope without seeing Luca every day. He missed him a lot, but managed not to think about him constantly, which helped him get through each day without feeling too sad. Every morning, he waited in front of Luca’s school, hoping to catch a glimpse. But after school, Luca seemed to disappear — like he vanished into thin air, leaving no trace. It was a small mystery Leo was determined to solve.

At school, a new OKAN class had been introduced this year. There were new Ukrainian students, along with some from the previous year. Among them was a boy named Andriy, who was eleven years old. Something about Andriy reminded Leo of Luca — it felt like déjà vu. The way Andriy behaved, often sitting alone, was very similar to how Luca had been at the beginning of the last year.

This time, Leo didn’t wait. He approached Andriy right away, started a conversation, and even played a game together — the same one Luca used to play. Later that day, during the last break, they talked again, this time in Russian. Andriy asked Leo why he had come over and chosen to play with him. In that moment, Leo remembered watching Luca sit alone, wishing he had done more.

He simply said, “It’s because you’re sitting there alone, and I don’t like seeing that.”

Spending time with Andriy felt like a second chance — a way to do the things Leo had wished he had done with Luca last year. His Russian had improved too, something that had held him back before. That improvement allowed him to connect in ways he hadn’t been able to before.

But Andriy would never replace Luca. Their connection was different. Still, it was comforting to have someone to talk to every day.

Interestingly, the OKAN teacher had noticed Leo and Andriy walking together, looking a bit surprised, as if thinking, What the hell, he’s got another friend already? But that wasn’t the case at all.

Leo also noticed a strange pattern: every time he saw the OKAN teacher in the morning, he would see Luca later that same day. It had happened a couple of times now, feeling like more than just a coincidence.

One day, for example, Leo saw the OKAN teacher while riding his bike to school. Later, he spotted Luca in Oudenaarde. He wanted to stop and talk but couldn’t find a quick place to park his bike. He was a bit scared too — though less so than usual. It felt as if their story was unfolding in a specific way, and Leo wasn’t sure if he would get the same chance again. But he would be ready, just in case.

Finally, Leo now had access to Luca’s class schedule, which was very helpful for his future plans. They even had ICT classes at the same time on the same day. This meant Leo could, in theory, respond in real time if Luca read his messages during class. That small possibility made him feel more connected, even if they weren’t directly in touch.

He felt like he was getting closer to finding the right way to bring that spark back. There was a quiet certainty inside him that it would happen soon — and when it did, it would be amazing.


Chapter 17
Am I Good Enough

One ordinary afternoon, Leo was biking home from school at a relaxed pace. As he passed by Luca’s school, something—or rather, someone—caught his eye. At first, Leo thought with amusement, That kid really looks like Luca. But then it clicked—Wait… that is Luca!

Without hesitation, Leo swerved off the road for a better look. And sure enough, it was him. It marked the very first time Leo had ever seen Luca after school. For the longest time, Leo had assumed Luca always left quickly, but now it was clear—he simply stayed outside later than expected.

Luca wasn’t alone. He was accompanied by his close friend from last year. Driven by curiosity and a quiet longing, Leo followed them from a respectful distance. The two boys made their way to a nearby store. Leo waited outside, contemplating whether he should say something when they came back out.

Eventually, the boys emerged from the store. They played joyfully, chasing each other and hiding behind trees. Their carefree energy made Leo feel slightly out of place—like a spectator watching a world he used to belong to but couldn’t re-enter. He watched as Luca laughed and ran, clearly having the time of his life. And in that moment, Leo felt a pang of something he didn’t want to admit: That’s a kind of joy I can’t give him anymore.

It stung.

It felt as if Luca had completely moved on, like Leo no longer existed in his memory. Luca didn’t seem to notice him at all—just as he hadn’t that time he’d recognized another mutual friend but not Leo.

The two boys eventually sat down to eat candy, settling on a spot near the street. Across the road, Leo stood quietly with his bike, observing them from a distance. Still unnoticed, Leo considered heading home. But before doing so, he made one final decision: to turn around, ride past them, and maybe give a quick wave.

As he passed, Leo raised a hand in Luca’s direction. Only Luca’s friend saw the gesture. After that, Leo circled back to glance once more from afar—but they were gone. The bench was empty.

Thinking they may have gone to the train station, Leo rode there quickly. But by the time he arrived, there was no sign of them.

And just like that, the day was over.





Chapter 18 – Sports Make Friends

Leo’s sister, Lena, had recently taken up karate at a nearby sports center. One Saturday, she came home with surprising news: she had spotted two very familiar faces—Luca and his sister, Leyla. According to Lena, Leyla was playing football while Luca was busy on the tennis court.

The revelation hit Leo like a bolt from the blue. Luca had been so close this entire time, and yet Leo had no idea. Suddenly, all the strange coincidences started making sense—like how he always seemed to see the OKAN teacher on mornings that later brought a glimpse of Luca. The sports center, as it turned out, was right near where the OKAN teacher lived. The pieces were finally coming together.

Armed with this new knowledge, Leo felt a renewed sense of hope. He never would have imagined Luca being into sports—especially tennis. That detail caught him off guard. But more importantly, it opened a door: a fresh chance to reconnect.

Leo made up his mind. He would visit the sports center, try to confirm if Luca was truly there, and if the moment was right—and Luca wasn’t surrounded by friends—he’d consider joining the tennis sessions himself. It felt like the clean start he’d been waiting for.

This time, things were different. Thanks to his ongoing conversations with Andriy, Leo’s Russian had improved significantly. That alone gave him more confidence than ever before. Text messages had their limits, but being in a shared space, bonded by a common activity, seemed like the perfect path forward. A game, a rally, a smile—that might be all it would take.




Chapter 19 – The Online Disaster


While waiting with Andriy at the station before his train arrived, Leo had no idea the day was about to spiral into one of the most painful memories of his journey. After playing around for a bit, he made his way to the bus stop. There, by pure chance, he saw someone he recognized—an old friend of Luca’s. The boy noticed Leo too and greeted him in Russian as he got on the bus with a friend.

Curious and hopeful, Leo gathered the courage to ask about Luca—if they were still in touch, how he was doing. What came next stunned him. The boy smirked and replied, “I know you miss your favorite person… your boyfriend.” The word hit Leo like a slap. Boyfriend? How did he know that? When Leo asked, the boy simply said, “You told me before.”

The questions didn’t stop there. With a teasing tone, the boy asked, “Are you going to marry him?” Flustered and caught off guard, Leo said “yes” almost instinctively—prompting loud laughter. The bus ride turned into a flood of anxious thoughts. The boy clearly knew more than he should have, and Leo couldn’t tell if he was being serious, or just messing around. But what scared him most was the boy’s final comment before Leo got off the bus: “I’ll tell him something about you.”

Those words echoed all the way home.

A few days later, Leo saw the same boy again on the bus. Determined to get answers, he approached him. The boy greeted him and mentioned casually that he had “told Luca something,” though he didn’t say what. Desperate to reconnect with Luca, Leo asked if he had Telegram. The boy nodded and even gave him Luca’s contact.

Leo sent a message. Just a simple “Hi.” A while later, a reply came from the account.

“Who are you?”

Leo replied: “It’s Leo. The guy from bus 63.”

But the response was cold and confused.

“I don’t know you. I don’t take bus 63 or 307 anymore.”

Before Leo could say anything else, the boy who had given him the contact suddenly grabbed Leo’s phone and started typing on it without permission — pretending to be Leo.

When Luca asked how Leo had gotten his contact, the boy typed:
“I’m a hacker.”

Luca was shocked and confused. The boy laughed as he continued to type more nonsense.

Panicking, Leo snatched the phone back and quickly typed:
“That wasn’t me. It was your stupid friend saying that.”

But the damage had already been done. Moments later, Leo saw the notification he had feared most:

Blocked.

He sat there, stunned, holding a silent phone.

As soon as the bus stopped, Leo got off and confronted the boy. He told him he had to explain the truth to Luca and ask him to unblock him. But the boy didn’t seem to care. He didn’t do it. Leo went home heartbroken and helpless, unsure what to do next.

But he couldn’t just sit there.

Grabbing his bike, he rode to the station. He knew some of the boy’s friends hung out there. Most of them were rough—teenagers who smoked, caused trouble, and intimidated everyone around them. Leo was terrified. But his fear didn’t stop him. He walked up to them, still shaken, and asked for help.

To his surprise, they listened.

He asked them for the boy’s Telegram, and they gave it to him. Leo messaged him, pleading:
“Tell Luca it was you saying that, not me. Please. He needs to know.”

Eventually, the boy replied.

He said that Luca told him:
“I don’t want to be friends with him because I don’t really know him.”

Leo stared at those words, frozen.

It felt like his heart cracked right down the middle. After everything—after all the waiting, the messages, the little moments, the memories—it came down to this:
“I don’t know him.”

For a while, Leo felt like giving up completely. But even as he sat in that storm of sadness, something in him stayed strong. Maybe this wasn’t the end. Maybe it was just another trial to face. Because no matter how much it hurt, part of him still believed in what he felt.

He wasn’t ready to give up just yet.





Chapter 20 – It’s Table Tennis, Not Just Tennis…

I had been waiting for this moment ever since I learned about Luca’s sports center. After all the anxiety and uncertainty, a wave of nervousness washed over me as I approached the entrance, the sounds of laughter and energy spilling out from inside.

Once inside the training area, I scanned the room for familiar faces. My heart skipped a beat when I spotted Luca on the other side, practicing with a small group. He looked focused, moving gracefully as he hit the ball back and forth under the watchful eye of the table tennis coach. A rush of warmth filled me at the sight of him so engaged in something he loved.

Gathering my courage, I passed by him and took a seat on the nearby couch, hoping to watch without interrupting. Luca recognized me, but his expression didn’t seem happy. My heart raced as I sat there, feeling both excited and anxious. He looked even cooler than I remembered, and I couldn’t help but admire him from a distance.

After a while, Luca got distracted by the table tennis coach, and I seized the opportunity to sneak away. I noticed a staircase leading up to a floor with a big window, where I could still see him. I watched as he glanced around, clearly looking for me because he hadn’t seen me leave. It was a fascinating moment—a small thrill of connection even from afar.

Later, I asked the coach if I could join the training sessions, and he replied with a simple “yes.” My heart lifted at the thought of playing table tennis with Luca next time. As I made my way back to my sister, I caught Luca’s eye again. He passed me with a straight face, and I couldn’t help but wonder what he was thinking. His expression was so neutral; it didn’t give me any clear indication of how he felt. He knew about the situation with Telegram and recognized that it was me sitting there, but he didn’t say anything. His lack of reaction was confusing for both of us.

When the practice ended, my sister and I went to get our bikes. Luca’s sister was there too, taking her bike. As I looked back, I noticed Luca riding a scooter—just like I used to do (not electric). I had planned to pretend I was there just for the sport, but that idea quickly fell apart. As my sister and I were leaving, I turned around, knowing he was heading to Oudenaarde, and we crossed paths. I pretended I didn’t know him and kept moving straight ahead.

As I passed his sister, I decided to follow them for a bit before turning around to cross paths with Luca again. This time, he came from the opposite direction. I waved a friendly “hi” with a smile, but his facial expression remained the same as before—neutral and unreadable. I didn’t want to make things uncomfortable, so I made sure not to follow them too closely or accompany them back to his house.

This confirmed a new theory I had: he might be moving back to Oudenaarde, which would be great since otherwise, he lived too far away. Now that I had joined his sport, I felt a mix of excitement and stress. I just hoped he didn’t hate me for being there.





Chapter 21 – First Training Session

The day of Leo's first table tennis training had finally arrived, and nerves clung to him like static. As he stepped into the lively sports hall, he scanned the room with cautious anticipation. On the far side, he spotted Luca, quietly chatting with his sister, Leyla. A wave of tension and excitement surged through Leo, but he reminded himself to stay calm and focused.

The session soon got underway. As luck would have it, Leo was paired with Luca for a match. Anxious as he was, he noticed something unexpected—Luca didn’t appear uncomfortable or cold. In fact, his expression was neutral, his actions polite. There was no tension, no visible irritation. For Leo, this subtle normalcy was a welcome relief.

At one point during their rally, Luca delivered a sharp, well-placed shot that Leo fumbled. A quiet “sorry” came from Luca—not mocking, but sincere, almost like an acknowledgment of the effort. It was a fleeting moment, but it stayed with Leo.

After the training session wrapped up, Leo found himself in a casual conversation with Leyla. She came across as approachable and kind. To make the interaction smoother and more respectful, Leo used a mix of Russian and Dutch. Their chat was friendly, simple, and natural—nothing heavy, just enough to form the beginnings of a more comfortable connection.

As Leo left the hall that day, there was a subtle but meaningful shift in the air. The fear of rejection had loosened its grip just a little, replaced by the first fragile signs of possibility.




Chapter 22 – OKAN Returns Day

When OKAN’s return day came, it felt like Leo had stepped back in time. The familiar rhythms of the schoolyard buzzed with energy, and there, standing in the courtyard among a group of Ukrainian students, was Luca. It had been months since Leo had last seen him at school. Their eyes met briefly—Luca’s expression was unreadable, not unfriendly but far from warm. Still, just the sight of him stirred something nostalgic in Leo’s chest.

As the day went on, a few of the Ukrainian students began teasing Leo about old messages he had once sent to Luca. The tone was light and joking, but the words carried an edge that left Leo feeling exposed and uneasy. Before the moment could grow uncomfortable, one of the teachers nearby stepped in. With a calm presence, the teacher dismissed the teasing with a firm yet kind response, quietly reassuring Leo that it wasn’t worth getting upset over.

The day ended on a note of mixed emotions. There was longing, yes—but also a reminder. Rebuilding bridges wouldn’t be simple. Not every step toward reconnecting with Luca would come without friction. Still, just seeing him again, even from a distance, marked a quiet milestone in Leo’s journey.



Chapter 23 – Luca’s New School and Behavior

News about Luca’s new school reached Leo through a mutual friend. The updates stirred a complex mix of emotions. From what Leo heard, Luca’s new environment seemed full of opportunities—early dismissal times, more engaging activities, and even access to table tennis tables on campus. The picture painted was one of growth and possibility. Leo couldn’t help but feel a hint of envy, imagining Luca thriving in a place that seemed to suit him so well. At the same time, there was admiration—Leo was happy to know that Luca had found something better.

But not every piece of news was bright.

That same friend shared a troubling story. One day at school, another student had apparently irritated Luca enough to push him past his limits. In a moment of frustration, Luca had spat on the student. The situation quickly escalated, and the school ended up calling his mother. It was jarring to hear—a sharp contrast to the calm and graceful image Leo often held in his mind.

Rather than judging, Leo became more curious. The incident suggested that Luca might be wrestling with something deeper—emotions, adjustment, or maybe pressure he hadn’t fully processed. Leo decided to gently ask more questions, hoping the friend could offer context. Not out of gossip, but from a genuine desire to understand the Luca behind the story—a boy not just shaped by strength or talent, but by the same complex emotions Leo himself often faced.



Chapter 24 – Luca’s Birthday Preparation

As the chill of December settled in, Leo found himself thinking more and more about Luca. With the first of the month approaching, he remembered Luca’s birthday and began planning a small gesture to mark the occasion. Wanting to be sure, Leo gently confirmed the date with Luca’s sister, Leyla. She smiled and assured him it was indeed December 1st—and, to Leo’s quiet relief, agreed to help deliver a gift on his behalf.

The gift wasn’t extravagant, but it was heartfelt. A cheerful birthday card, carefully written in Ukrainian, carried Leo’s light humor and sincerity. Alongside it, he included €25 as a small token of goodwill—a way of saying, “I still care,” even from a distance.

The message inside the card read:

“Happy Birthday, Luca!! I hope you have a wonderful day! I wanted to send you something extra special, but the postman told me to get out of the mailbox! Just kidding—have a nice day!”

With everything ready, Leo met Leyla outside her school to hand off the gift. Their meeting was short, but meaningful. She even shared her phone number so they could coordinate the drop-off, a simple gesture that deepened Leo’s trust in her. He thanked her with genuine appreciation, knowing how much it meant to have someone willing to bridge that small but important gap between him and Luca.

Though Leo wouldn’t be there to see Luca’s reaction, the thought of him reading the card—smiling even slightly—was enough to make the effort feel worthwhile.




Chapter 25 – Positive Interaction with Leyla

Leo’s conversations with Leyla began to grow more meaningful as the days passed. What had started as a simple gift exchange soon revealed the possibility of a budding connection—one rooted in kindness, curiosity, and quiet trust.

During their brief meeting, Leo offered a casual but sincere gesture: if Leyla ever needed help with anything, especially technical issues, he’d be happy to assist. To his surprise, she mentioned a computer problem she hadn’t been able to figure out. Though she didn’t go into detail, it was enough of an opening. Leo offered to help troubleshoot it whenever she had time, and Leyla responded with a nod of agreement. No specific plans were made, but the offer was there—open, genuine, and unpressured.

Leyla struck Leo as warm and approachable, someone who carried both a calm presence and a subtle depth. He began to see her not just as Luca’s sister, but as a person in her own right—someone who might one day help rebuild the fragile bridge between him and Luca.

For now, Leo didn’t want to rush anything. Whether they talked about computers, table tennis, or simply shared short chats between schools, each moment carried potential. In every small exchange, he sensed the beginnings of something meaningful—not only a new friendship, but perhaps, a gentle path forward.

So he chose to take things slowly, appreciating the little victories, and holding onto hope for what might one day come next.



Chapter 26: The Tangled Truth

As time passed, Leo believed he was developing feelings for Leyla. They spent more time talking, even walking home together after training when her bike had a flat tire. It felt natural, like a small moment of connection. But Leo noticed he was always the one leading the conversations. Leyla responded warmly sometimes, neutrally other times, but rarely took the initiative. It wasn’t bad, but it left Leo wondering where he truly stood with her.

Then, a surprising realization dawned on him: the feelings he thought were for Leyla were not really for her at all. Leo had been misleading himself. What stirred his emotions was someone else—someone Leyla knew well: her brother, Luca.

One evening, Leo messaged Leyla on Snapchat, trying to confess what he really felt. The conversation was awkward and hesitant. Leo admitted that he had feelings for her brother but was too scared to say it out loud. Leyla was confused, unsure how to respond. She said she couldn’t really help him, since she wasn’t Luca and couldn’t decide for either of them.

Leo promised himself then and there not to ask Leyla for help with his complicated feelings or his relationship—or lack thereof—with Luca. It was a problem he had to face on his own.



Chapter 27 – The Shadows of the Past

There were other shadows lingering in Leo’s mind—memories and people that wouldn’t quite fade. Among them were Samir and Katya. Samir, Emir’s brother, now attended the same school as Luca. And Katya—the girl who had once mocked Leo after he sent that heartfelt message to Luca—was still up to her old tricks. Her teasing hadn’t stopped. She continued making strange jokes, throwing out comments that weren’t true, like claiming she was in love with Leo or saying that Samir was jealous.

But then, in the middle of her usual banter, she said something that made Leo stop. She claimed that Luca had feelings for him.

Leo didn’t take it seriously—not at first. Katya was known for saying outrageous things just to provoke a reaction. And yet… the words lingered. What if there was a grain of truth buried in the joke? Could it really be possible? Or was it just another one of her games?

Adding to the uncertainty was Luca’s sudden absence from table tennis. He had simply stopped showing up, and Leo had no explanation for why. Was it just the season or a scheduling change? Or was it something more personal? A reaction to something Leo had done? The lack of answers gnawed at him. With no way to ask directly—especially after being blocked on Telegram—Leo was left with silence. Over a month had passed since he had last seen Luca.

Determined to understand, Leo resolved to look elsewhere for answers. If he couldn’t speak with Luca himself, perhaps Samir or Katya held pieces of the puzzle. Maybe, just maybe, they could shed light on why Luca had pulled away—or whether there had ever been a spark of truth in Katya’s words.




Chapter 28 – Unanswered Questions
Things with Leyla remained steady, though not without uncertainty. She and Leo stayed in contact, but he had started to notice a change—her Snap activity had declined. It was a small detail, but one that gnawed at him. He couldn’t help but wonder if it had something to do with Luca. Had Luca said something to her? Had someone passed along a message? Or was she simply losing interest in continuing their conversations? Leo had no answers—only speculation.

But over time, a deeper realization began to settle in.

Leo had spent weeks believing he might have feelings for Leyla—an idea that had quietly taken root in the aftermath of everything with Luca. It seemed easier to shift his focus to someone kind, someone familiar, someone close to the one he couldn’t forget. But the truth was slowly surfacing: those feelings weren’t real. Or rather, they weren’t about her.

They were about someone she knew.

Luca.

What Leo had mistaken for affection toward Leyla was, in truth, a reflection of the emotional trail Luca had left behind. Leyla had simply been nearby—friendly, open, and unintentionally offering a space for Leo’s confusion to settle. But it was never really about her.

And once that truth came into view, it changed everything.

As Valentine’s Day crept closer, Leo briefly considered doing something—writing a small message, giving a token of kindness. But even that felt wrong now. Not because Leyla didn’t deserve kindness, but because it wouldn’t be sincere. It wouldn’t be honest.

The real question had never been about her.

It was about Luca.

Was Leo ready to move on?

Or was he still standing in a quiet space between past and possibility, between what was lost and what still lingered?

One thing had become clear:
Leo didn’t want to mislead anyone anymore—least of all himself.




Chapter 29: The Quiet Armor

Sometimes, the more is learned, the less is understood.

Luca had always been a mystery—part silence, part spark. Recently, that silence felt heavier than before. Leo started asking around, reaching out to people at Luca’s new school, trying to piece together fragments of his world. One Ukrainian friend said Luca had no friends there, that he was bullied, called stupid by others. But Leo didn’t take those words at face value—not from someone who might have been caught in schoolyard dramas. Still, the rumor lingered. Even a whisper can carry a shadow of truth.

Then another piece came from someone Leo knew better—a table tennis friend, who Leo hadn’t realized also went to Luca’s school. This friend mentioned a study class they once shared. “He didn’t say much,” the friend said. “He just... didn’t seem to care.” That hit harder than expected. Leo pictured Luca sitting in a room full of voices, completely disconnected.

No one knew exactly what happened to Luca. No one knew why he left his old school—the school where his friends still were, where he used to laugh, where he and Leo had met. It was a good school. Something must have pushed him away. Maybe something personal. Something painful. Or maybe it wasn’t just one thing—maybe it was a slow retreat, one layer of armor at a time.

Leo remembered how Luca always wore his hood up—his hoodie and jacket hood layered, like a shell. But when they talked, Luca would always take it off. That small gesture said more than words. It meant: I’m listening. I’m here. I trust you. And now, all Leo heard from Luca was silence.

Maybe Luca already knew Leo would be going to the same school next year. Leo hadn’t told Luca directly but had spoken to his friend Danylo about it. Asked about table tennis, about the school. Leo explained that Bernardus didn’t feel like the right place anymore, that Atheneum made more sense. Leo saw the pieces click in Danylo’s head. If Danylo knew, maybe Luca did too.

And it was true—Leo was going to Atheneum. The same school as Luca.

For a long time, it had been uncertain. But now, it was becoming real. That possibility, that quiet hope: they might walk the same halls again, share some classes, live the same days.

No miracles were expected. But maybe, just maybe, being near Luca again could give them both a chance. A chance to understand each other. To listen. To speak. To try again.

So Leo turned their story into something else—something he could hold. A mobile game. Not a game to win or beat—just a quiet story told through AI images and robotic voices. A reflection of how they met, how it unfolded, and how it was still unfolding. Names changed. Activities tweaked. But the feelings? Untouched. Real.

Sometimes Leo wondered… what if Leyla played it one day? What if she saw herself through his eyes? What if Luca saw it too? Would they understand? Would they feel something?

No one knew if it would change anything. But one thing was clear:

Without Luca, the world felt lonelier.

And maybe—just maybe—Leo would be the one to help Luca find his way back to something real again.





Chapter 30 — A Golden Distance (20/05/2025)


Leo stood across the street from the school — the one Luca now attended. It was a place Leo had imagined countless times but never truly seen until that moment. The building itself wasn’t extraordinary, but it felt surreal. It was like stepping into a photo that had only ever existed in his head. He had wondered for so long where Luca walked, where he spent his days. And now… there it was. Reality.

And there he was.

But Luca was different.

He walked out of the school with confidence — a sharpness in his clothes, a calm assurance in his step. The hoodie he used to pull tightly over his head was gone. His posture was open, his pace relaxed. He wasn’t alone either. A group of Belgian classmates surrounded him — laughing, talking. And he smiled.

He didn’t see Leo.

Or maybe he did… but didn’t recognize him.
Or maybe… he chose not to.

That realization struck Leo in a quiet, heavy way.

He had wished for Luca’s happiness — and now, it seemed, Luca had found it.
But not with him. Without him.

Luca walked away, on foot. The same street Leo stood on suddenly felt far too wide, even though it was just a crossing. Luca didn’t glance back. And Leo didn’t call out.

It hurt. Not because Luca seemed happy. But because Leo wasn’t a part of that happiness. For so long, he had carried something silently — a kind of invisible offering, a quiet promise, a story never told. And now, someone else had offered what Leo never had the chance to. Or perhaps… Luca had found it within himself all along.

Still, there was something in Luca’s face — something subtle. A tightness behind the smile, a tension in the way he moved. As if he were trying just a bit too hard to belong. Like he hadn’t fully become who he wanted to be — just someone who had learned how to appear like he had.

Leo recognized that look.
He’d worn it too.

He had asked around — spoken with people who knew pieces of Luca’s past. Some said Luca had been bullied at his old school. Others said he barely spoke in class. A few described him with words Leo refused to believe. But Leo listened, quietly fitting together fragments of truth.

Maybe Luca had left not to run from something, but to restart. To rebuild.

Maybe that’s why Leo had chosen the same school — Atheneum.
Not to chase, but to begin again.

He wasn’t running toward Luca anymore.
He was walking his own way now — creating his own world, strange as it sounded. His own sandbox.

But still, he hoped — that maybe someday, the path would curve. That maybe one afternoon, as school let out, they’d find themselves on the same street again. Maybe Leo would have his bike. Maybe Luca would be walking, just like today.

And maybe, just maybe, Leo would finally say:

“Hey Luca, long time. How’s life here?”

And if Luca answered…
That moment wouldn’t be a return.
It would be a rebeginning.

Because even if this world felt lonelier without Luca in it, Leo was still walking through it. Still searching. Still hoping.



Chapter-End


And this chapter… wasn’t the end.

Some stories need time to breathe.
Some feelings need space to grow.

This game was only the beginning — a reflection of what was, and a glimpse of what might be.

The next part? It’s still being written. In real life. In quiet moments. In small changes.

When it’s time, the story will return.

Until then…

Thank you for walking this far.
To be continued.
